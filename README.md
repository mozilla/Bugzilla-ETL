Setup
-----

You will also require:

  * A MySQL/Maria database with Mozilla's Bugzilla schema ([old public version can be found here](http://people.mozilla.com/~mhoye/bugzilla/))
  * An ElasticSearch cluster to hold the bug version documents
  * A ```settings.json``` file to connect everything together


The JSON file of settings must be provided as an
argument in the command line (see [example command line script](https://github.com/klahnakoski/Bugzilla-ETL/blob/master/resources/scripts/bz_etl.bat)). Examples of settings files can be found in [./resources/settings](resources/settings)
