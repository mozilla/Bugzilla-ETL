        "comment": "Okay, layout has been changed and it works correctly except in one case. Fixing\nthat requires compositor changes.\n\nThe way fixed background attachment works is that layout sets the\nNS_VIEW_PUBLIC_FLAG_DONT_BITBLT flag which tells the compositor that the view\nshould be repainted and not bitblt when moving or scrolling the view.\n\nThe nsScrollingView::Scroll() code has been changed to check the scrolled view's\nflags and if that flag is set, then the view is repainted and not bitblt'd\n\nThe case that doesn't currently work is when there's a non-scrollable nested\nelement that has a fixed background attachment (see example below). What happens\nin this case is that because the scrolled view can be bitblt'd we go ahead and\nbitblt it. However, one of its child views can not be bitblt'd, and see we need\nto make sure that it is repainted after doing the scroll.\n\nDoing this efficiency (i.e., not walking each of the scrolled view's\nchild frames each time checking if any of them have this flag bit set) requires\ncompositor changes.\n\n<HTML>\n<BODY>\nSome text\n<DIV style=\"background-attacment: fixed; ...\">\nSome text in a DIV\n</DIV>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>",

When I use\nthe plugins from Nav3.0, NGLayout crashes immediately on\nloading the page!\n\nIn the WAV tests, a LiveAudio plugin panel saying \"Loading\naudio file...\" is shown.  Clicking on the panel a few times\ncauses a crash.  The behaviour is identical with both plugin\nversions.\n\nHere's a sample output from my NGLayout on a WAV object test:\n\n  loaded plugin npaudio.dll for mime type audio/wav\n  result of creating plugin adapter: 0\n  successfully created plugin instance 01253dd0 for\n    npaudio.dll, mimetype audio/wav\n  instance start called\n\nThe output is similar in the AVI tests.",

I'm changing this bug to capture the\nidea that the registry file should store relative pathnames instead of absolute\npathnames.  The pathnames should be stored relative to the directory that\ncontains the registry file and the pathname handling must be careful to rebuild\nthe absolute name correctly (i.e. the CWD must NOT be used :-)\n\nIf the user enters a pathname for the profile directory, we must detect whether\nit is an absolute or relative pathname and store/rebuild it accordingly.\n\nThe problem we're solving here is that on Unix the user's home directory was\ncopied to a new place - including the registry that still pointed to the old\nplace.  At best this is confusing, at worst it would fail because the old place\ngot deleted.  By using relative names, the whole problem is avoided.",

The tone of that proposed text was simply \ninappropriate for release notes. We're talking about a problem with *spacing* \nfor the first release; the text can still be read.

This bug is *nothing* like the Nav4 CSS1 \n*crash* bugs that so hampered adoption of CSS on the web. Is the glass 0.5% \nempty or 99.5% full? And does any other browser support this many standards this \ndeeply simultaneously across platforms? No. It is not the few-and-far-between \nflaws in standards compliance of Netscape 6 that will be holding back the \nusability of standards; it is overwhelmingly the yawning holes of IE5.5 Win and \nIE5 Mac.\n\nDavid: Since Nav4+ and IE4+ and Opera 4+ support visibility, that covers the \noverwhelming majority of current browser users. They can use the workaround, \naccept the bug in the first release, or not use the feature; their call.",

You might be right if what the printer\nsystem is handed over is just a plain text file. Then, the printing system\ncan do whatever it wants to do (adding header, footer with page number,\ntitle, etc). However, what Netscape gives the printing system is, in\nUnix/X11, a postscript file. Do you think the printer system has to/can\nmanipulate this postscript file (e.g. resizing the whole page and adding\nheader and footer)?  Things like n-page up, duplex printing, banner page\nwith title are certainly in the realm of the printing system. However,\nadding headers and footer with the page title, page number, date, the\nURL of the page has to be taken care of by Mozilla. Please, also note\nthat Unix/X11 version offers a way to print to a file. If the printing\nsystem has to add header and footer, PS file obtained by 'printing to\na file' would be different from the hardcopy.\n\n\nAD> So that's why Unix and Windows printouts differ: Mozilla just passes this\nAD> information to the Windows printer and omits it on Unix. In that case, you\nAD> really have to put these information into ENV variables or replace specific\nAD> parts of the commandline (as suggested in the first post in this thread).\n\n  I guess your original question is still valid. I've been also wondering\nwhy Windows version of NS can add date, page number, URL (which is very\nhandy), title while Unix/X11 version can't.\n\n  When I printed out with 2001-04-03 build for Linux, I was pleasantly\nsuprised to see the page title, page number ( x of y ) and date (current)\nwere printed in header and footer. However, there's still one item\nmissing which is present in print-out of MS-Windows version, which is\nthe URL of the page being printed. Now, I got really curious as to why\non earth  MS-Windows version can print all four items (title, url, date,\nand page number) while Unix/X11 version can only three of them (title,\ndate and page number). I guess this(printing out URL as well in Unix/X11\nversion of Mozilla) should be an easy fix.\n\n   Jungshik Shin",

In DOS 1.0\nthere were no subdirectories, so the issue mever came up The comand line\ninterface, which is a very different thing from the API's, had support for '/'\nup until DOS 5.0, I believe. Once they went to a GUI, I believe that support for\n'/' in the edit boxes was spotty at best.\nDoes anybody know what Apple uses in their API's? As of OS-X, I presume that the\nUnix base for the underlying OS implies that '/' will work.\nOne of the strengths of the prefs.js file is the ability to edit it in an\nemergency. If it depends on non-7-bit-ASCII characters, It will be much harder\nto deal with.\nThis shouldn't be the only factor in the decision, of course, but I see no\nreason to mess with a fairly widespread standard unnecessarily.\nIdeally, the path separator could be either '/' or '\\' (and any others in use as\nwell) and Mozilla versions from all OS's would recognize all of them.\nI am by no means claiming that '/' is common to all OS's. There was a recent\nthread on alt.folklore.computers that went into this at great length. Some of\nthe older OS's had positively byzantine methods of specifying the path. As far\nas I could tell, a lot of them used ' ' as a separator, but they usually were\nquite limited as to how far you could nest the directories.",

The prefs which need to be fixed for this are the ones which are\nabsolute paths to the top-level mail directories. For example, \"mail.directory\",\n\"mail.server.server1.directory\", etc. Once those top-level dirs are resolved,\nfolder names can be appended in whatever charset.\n\n> There you could specify different directory location for mail/news instead of\nsubdirectory of Profile.\n\nYeah, relative paths cannot always be used - as in this case. If the file pref\nto be saved is not a subdirectory of the profile dir, it will be written out as\nan absolute file path. BTW, even if a file pref can be made relative, the\nabsolute path pref will still be written out until some point when compatibility\nwith older builds can be dropped (maybe never). Given that, we'll have to\nsupport both kinds of paths anyway.",

If the 3rd\nbyte of that sequence happens to be '/', then you'll be inserting \"%2F\" which\nwill make the last 2 bytes of that sequence \"%2\" which would mean the\ntranslated UCS2 byte would be a different byte, plus you'd be adding in an\nextra 'F' before the next character.\n\nAll this basically means is that you have to do the ReplaceSubstring() step on\nthe UCS2 string rather than the UTF8 string.. \n\nfortunately, SplitPath() is working on PRUnichar strings, so it is safe.\n\nI see this in two places. It will unfortunately complicate the code because\nyou'll have to make a temporary nsAutoString somewhere, but I think its the\nonly way to avoid this problem.\n\nother than that, the patch looks great!",

        "comment": "A couple quick comments on this:\n\n1) Anything that currently uses a file path that is within the user's profile\ndirectory needs to be converted to use a relative path, but absolute paths\nshould also be allowed.  For example, \"ImapMail/mail/rules.dat\" vs\n\"/var/foo/mail/rules.dat\".  Perhaps this could be implemented as\nresource://profile/ImapMail/mail/rules.dat vs file:///var/foo/mail/rules.dat? \nWould that be a bad idea?\n\n2) From a UI perspective, I think the user should be shown only absolute paths,\nand they should be converted to relative paths if they are within the profile\ndir.  The average user won't notice a difference, until they move their profile\ndir and find that everything still works.\n\n3) Mac OS uses \":\" as a path seperator and \"/\" is a valid character in a\nfilename.  If we're storing paths as URLs, \"Folder:file/name.txt\" can just be\nencoded as \"Folder/file%2Fname.txt\" which probably already works in file://\nURLs.  Obviously a filename like that isn't portable to Windows, but that's not\nMozilla's problem.\n\n4) I think the ability to copy a profile between platforms is REALLY cool. \nAnything referencing an absolute path will break, but that should only be things\nthe user has explicitly defined (and thus is aware of).  If a Windows user keeps\nhis IMAP data at qb:\\Imap\\, he'll be expecting Mac OS not to be able to find it\nthere if he moves his profile over, and he'll know he needs to change the path\nmanually.  However, if he keeps everything in the default locations, he should\nbe able to boot Linux and point Mozilla to \"/mnt/windows/Documents\\ and\\\nSettings/username/Application\\ Data/Mozilla/Profiles/default/a1b2c3d4.slt\" and\nhave everything work perfectly.

        "comment": "This is not fixed.  I've been using Mozilla a few months, starting with a 0.9\nrelease, moving to 1.0 and finally 1.1\n\nHear my saga...\n\nI run a home business and we had set up all the Windows98 computers to save all\nuser data to an NT server.  This means everything, the MyDocuments folder,\nFavorites for IE, Navigator profiles, Outlook email folders, etc.  The reason we\ndid this is because I don't want work stopping because a computer is fubar'd (we\ncan't ghost easily because each machine ahs different hardware - we're using a\nlot of used equipment).  If I have a work deadline, and my machine gets toasted,\nI need to be able to move to another machine, login and have everything, and go\nto work ASAP.  All our machines were setup so anyone could login and work on any\nof them as needed.\n\nWhen we decided to move to Mozilla for browsing, mail, news and calendaring, we\nset up all the profiles on the same server.  At the same time, we set up our own\nIMAP on a Redhat server and gathered our email via fetchmail and pointed to our\nIMAP server.  This worked great.  Even in the field with a laptop (different\nprofile, of course), I just hit my IMAP server and had access to all my email.\n\nThen we moved to a very rural location where we could not get cable, DSL or\nwireless.  Being back on dial-up meant I could not access our IMAP server away\nfrom home.  So I reconfigured Mozilla to grab my email via POP, turned off\nfetchmail, and manually moved all my email from the IMAP folders to the newly\ncreated Mozilla mail folders via the mail-and-news application.  \n\nI did this on a stationary PC at home.  I then copied the profile to my laptop.\n Since Mozilla was entirely fubar'd, and a reinstall didn't help, I rebuilt my\nlaptop from scratch.  Then I then wrote a little DOS batch file to copy the\nentire profile from my home box (which is on a network server) to my laptop\nmanually and vice-versa (and copy a few other things I need).\n\nBasically, it took me over a week, and way more research than was necessary, to\nfix my laptop due to all the absolute paths in various files within the profile.\n In spite of folders for each POP address already present, Mozilla made new ones\nand I had to manually change the directory in each case.\n\nIt's taken me scores of hours to get Mozilla working properly on both boxes, and\nmy batch files are about ten times longer than necessary since I have to specify\nthe exact path of every single file to be copied (now that I know which are safe\nto copy and which are not).  \n\nAnd once that was working properly, Mozilla crashed on every form submission (an\n*entire* crash of all applications) due to some problem with copying the .w and\n.s files.\n\nAt a minimum, the location of the main profile directory needs to exist in one\nhuman-editable file... all other paths should be relative to it.  \n\nAnd frankly, the profile manager should have a button to click to copy a profile\nfrom wherever it actually is to *exactly* the directory where I want it to be -\nand auto-convert anything that eneds to be converted.  \n\nI should not have needed to learn this much about Mozilla and what all the\nspecific files do in order to copy a profile.  It's been a bit much, and I can't\nsee the average user going through all this.  And it makes Mozilla look bad, my\nco-workers know I am the only Mozilla person around, and also know I have been\nunable to do my email at work for a few weeks now.\n\nI'm not writing to criticize, I don't know enough programming to actually help.\n Sorry.  I'm writing to clarify the types of issues that come up.  I need to\nstore my profile on a server *and* on a local machine *and* be able to\nsynchronize the two.  I've been using Mozilla just a couple months and this\nreally drove me crazy to the degree of thinking seriously about going back to IE\nand Outlook (god forbid!)  I can't go back now, I have learned too much.  ;)",

        "comment": "My added two cents: I have 10 or 20 filters categorizing mail into various mailing list folders, and often automatically marking them as \"read\".  Biff (moztraybiff.mozdev.org) often indicates I have new mail, and I'll take a look at the Thunderbird window, only to find an Inbox folder with no new messages, yet still has a star next to it indicating new mail.  That's one issue.\n\nIdeally, biff would only be activated if my inbox folder has new mail, and none of that new mail was automatically marked as junk and/or scam.  I don't know how much of that is configuration, how much of it is this bug, and how much of it is in other bugs (e.g. Bug 232104), but such a system would be perfect for me.\n",

        "comment": "(In reply to comment #0)\n> I was thinking of doing this - it's just a matter of adding a filter action,\n> and doing a folder notification.\n\nFolder notification is bug 201420.  This is a more important issue for IMAP (and maybe other mail types, but not POP) where the mail can be filtered into folders on the server.\n\nSuppression of notification when mail moved to certain folders is bug 224573; and suppression of notification for certain mail accounts is bug 104809.  Both features could be handled via a filter suppressing notification on a per-message basis, altho I think a per-account setting would be a reasonable feature to implement above and beyond \n\nI think the primary aspect of this bug is a filter action to control notification.  There are many aspects of this that could be implemented; perhaps the action could be:\n  Notify as:     None, Normal, Priority\nwhere Normal is the default action taken if no filters change the notification status.  If *all* new items are filtered with Notify As, None, then no new notification occurs.  If *any* new item is filtered with Notify As, Priority,\nthen the priority alert would apply -- a different sound, a colored tray icon.\n\nThis could obviously be much more complex, with individually configurable sounds, slide-up appearance, and tray-icon appearance, and there are many RFEs to that effect.  Also note that TB has implemented a different alert popup (in Windows, anyway) that shows information about the new messages, and that could also be finetuned even further with filters, if these were allowed to grow to that level of complexity.  I think in terms of maintainability and overall usefulness, a three-level scheme as I propose is a decent compromise; it would cover bug 190989, bug 219510, and possibly others I haven't found.",

Don't take this personally, but this kind of reply is symptomatic for the way a lot of bugs on Mozilla products are handled.\nMe, not a Mozilla developer but somebody kind enough to report bugs/enhancements on your product, makes a suggestion which might enable you to fix bugs easier and quicker, and gets a non-answer as a reply.\nA better reply might have been : \"Gee, indeed a logfile might sometimes come in handy. We currently have to rely on third parties to make these debugbuilds. Why not include them in our build procedure ? You know what, if you'd like a debugbuild of Thunderbird, you could find one there http://blabla.  Kind of you offering to use install these slow debugbuilds in your spare time. If the current situation is indeed all or nothing (nothing is logged or EVERYTHING), then maybe we ought to consider a more flexible logging. Or a medium logbuild.\"\n\n2) The guys from Qualcomm's Eudora, did manage to have logging in Eudora. Seemingly without much loss of speed.

This incredibly flexible logging lib features something called a RollingFileAppender. As the name implies, log files will be rotated automatically per day or size or ... .\n\n2) Of course, Magnus, I won't look at the code myself (maybe one day I will). The logs really aren't that much for me. They are meant for the Mozilla development team to decipher why something went wrong. The privilege of interpretation is rather reserved for them :-)\nEasy things like 'file x not found at location y' can of course be sufficient for me to fix it myself.\n\n3) I'm quite sure that somebody with a reproducable bug won't mind installing this debug version. The developers on their part are most likely interested in getting this logfile. Why then not making a single debug build available ? One of the latest nightly, one of the latest official.

        "comment": "Here is a rough outline of some issues associated with this bug, and my proposed approach.\n\nThe existing message flag MSG_FLAG_NEW conveys that a new message has been received since the last time the folder was viewed (but only as long as the application remains open - the flag is kept in memory and destroyed when exiting the application). MSG_FLAG_NEW is indirectly tied to BIFF notification and clearing.\n\nSo what happens when we restrict the class of messages that do BIFF notification? Do we continue to tie this to MSG_FLAG_NEW? That would mean that the NEW flag would only occur on messages that have been filtered to perform BIFF notification. But I believe that the existing NEW flag on messages and folders is useful, and should be preserved even when BIFF notification is modified by a filter.\n\nSo the approach that I propose is to introduce a new message flag MSG_FLAG_BIFF that would be used for BIFF control, and be the subject of this current bug. The existing MSG_FLAG_NEW flag will continue to operate in roughly the same way that it does currently (though I will probably propose in another bug that MSG_FLAG_NEW be preserved across mail sessions.)\n\nIf this path is followed, then there may be a need to identify which folders and messages are the one that caused the BIFF notification. I propose that the existing folder and message decoration associated with MSG_FLAG_NEW and BIFF state be modified to show a subtle difference between NEW and BIFF messages. That might be a larger or bolder decoration for the BIFF messages. That change in folder and message decoration will not be part of this current bug however.\n\nCurrently, message and folder BIFF state is spread between four variables: an array kept in the database, an array kept in the folder, a hasNewMessages boolean, and a count of new messages. The responsibility to maintain hasNewMessages and the new message count is separate from the flag, so each message editor has to set those independently. Prior to completing this bug, I want to simplify and consolidate that process somewhat, at the same time preparing for a possible MSG_FLAG_BIFF. That groundwork is being laid in bug 441932.",

The folder tooltip should directly match the messages flagged NEW in the folder.\n\n> I'm also not convinced that new should persist across mail sessions.

Whenever you open a folder, even days later, you will see all messages flagged that are new since the last time that you opened the folder. But as I said, this would be the subject of a different bug.\n\n> So I think this boils down to a UI/UE question, so I'm cc'ing Bryan.

The new-this-session\n> messages should be known about from the tray indicator and tooltip.\n> \n\nThe preceding comment dealt with new versus unread, so I assume that is the \"difference\" that you know. I would appreciate though any comments you have on the more immediate issue, at least for this bug, of separating \"New\" from \"Biff\", allowing more direct control of Biff through filters (this bug) and possibly as a folder property (not this bug), while keeping New as the indicator of \"You haven't seen this message yet in the message pane\". The tray indicator would match BIFF. The tooltip per folder would match NEW. At the moment for this bug, NEW would not persist over sessions - though it would be more valuable if it did, and that's where I'm headed. It's particularly useful for large volume email lists, RSS feeds, and newsgroups where I want to see what's happened since the last time that I opened the message pane.\n\n> However, several longstanding bugs -- the tray icon and account-New flag\n> persisting when shouldn't (all new messages moved to a different account and\n> read there), or clearing when shouldn't (explicit Get New Messages, or in the\n> suite, opening a new mail window), and those several about erroneous New count\n> display in the alert and the tooltip -- all make the distinction less useful\n> than it could be.\n> \n\nMy work-in-process patch for bug 441932 solves some of the issues involving NEW that I am aware of involving folder-level counts and flags. It does not address the server-level issues, that affect the tray icon and notifications. But those are coming. I'd really like to get to the point where we have precise control of when BIFF goes off - and have a virtual search folder that shows exactly what messages triggered the current notification. Which will bring up another point - when do you clear the BIFF flag? The existing code is inconsistent, which is why for example \"explicit Get New Messages\" clears NEW in some cases. That should always clear BIFF, but never clear NEW IMHO. Things get trickier with multiple servers all checking mail.\n",

It's a IMAP server and the server automatically sorts junk into the \"Junk\" folder. So new messages arrive in the Junk and in the Inbox folder in parallel (more in Junk than in Inbox). \n\nI would like to get notified only about the messages which are coming in the \"Inbox\" folder. So I just unchecked the option \"Check for new messages\" in the \"Junk\" folder. \n\nBut every time if a message in the \"Inbox\" folder arrives, I not only see the Message from the \"Inbox\", I also see the latest \"Junk\" messages. Because they are flagged \"New\" as well. \n\nSometimes the junk messages are newer (future dated) as the messages in the Inbox. So I just see four header lines of junk messages, but the message from the Inbox which triggered the notification isn't visible at all. \n\nSo it's not just a matter of taste introducing a new \"Biff\" flag, it's just a must if you would like to allow exclude some messages from the notification.\n\nI would like to see which messages are \"new\" as well, but I don't want get a notification about it.

        "comment": "Classic Eudora's approach on notifying users of new messages is different from Thunderbird's.  Eudora doesn't have a separate message status of new.  Instead it bolds mailbox names that have unread mail that are newer than 5 days (solves the old mail problem that bienvenu mentions above, and also persists across sessions), opens up mailboxes that get new mail put in them, and it automatically selects the first unread message at the end of a mailbox when its opened up.  I've got these last two items mostly working in Penelope already.  One common usage model is that new messages get filtered in to mailboxes, which are then automatically opened up.  You then close the mailboxes when you are done dealing with the messages in them.  So the open mailbox windows themselves act as the new mail notification system.\n\nEudora also has a filter action to control whether the user gets notified about messages that match the filter criteria, similar to what this bug is suggesting.  In addition to opening up mailboxes that get new messages that I mention above, you can also have it play a sound and/or put up a generic dialog saying that you have new mail.  You can set the default to do these notifications (or not to) on all messages, and then the filters can override that on a per-message basis.  As a filter action you can even open up messages in to their own separate windows so as to really highlight them.  On Windows Eudora there is a system tray icon that will tell you how many new messages you have, but not any specific message info like TB's biff.  In addition Eudora automatically does not notify the user (in any fashion: sound, new mail dialog, or opening mailboxes) on any messages that are marked as junk, or get transferred to the Trash mailbox by a filter.\n",

We have to separate out the win32 installer otherwise we'll end up with empty quotes on other platforms, which is interpreted as the cwd. I couldn't do the same sort of logic with the MARs on this one since we don't have a MOZ_MAKE_COMPLETE_MAR sortof var here. Only checking for existence here is fine though, imo.\n\nThe UPLOAD_EXTRA_FILES portion is currently going to be used for the $platform_info.txt files we must upload for releases.

The operations taking place for nightly builds have not changed at all - the upload step has just been moved to the subclass. The release builds are using the new upload target. I did not move the nightly builds to this in the interest of not making a big change right before I'll be gone for a week. I'll be moving them to the new target early in Q1.\n\nThe only other thing here is adding the 'env' parameter to make package/installer/mar so MOZ_PKG_PRETTYNAMES is applied correctly for release builds.\n\nI gave this a go on staging and everything seemed to work properly.",

In the past, it was convenient that when the next day's Nightly build became available, I only needed to do a regular update and I was back on the regular Nightly with the desired bug patch in place.\n\nWith this in mind, it would be disappointing that hourlies would be built with the update channel set to \"default\" instead of \"nightly\" because of forcing the inconvenience of having to manually download/install the next day's Nightly to \"restore\" things to the way they were.",

As such, I decided to just go with the horrific regex and give examples as to what we're trying to catch.\n\n* The \"universal_newlines=True\" is due to the minidump stackwalk output on Windows having CRLFs, which would otherwise break out regex (or at least require making it more complex).\n\n* We'll also need to change runpeptests.py (but not currently being used and will require adjusting the patch slightly + I guess we may end up using mozcrash there before we start using peptest again) and mozcrash (different repo). I'll file bugs for these two after this one; I'm just keen to get this part landed asap to help sheriffs.\n\nTry run at:\nhttps://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=7cfcf4044c6e\n\nExamples of crashes with top frame on that try run:\nhttps://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=17224313&tree=Try\nhttps://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=17225063&tree=Try\nhttps://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=17225055&tree=Try",
