More JSON Tools!
================

This set of modules solves three problems:

* JSON encoding is slow (`jsons.encode`)
* We want to iterate over massive JSON easily (`jsons.stream`)
* JSON is great for configuration, but is missing hyperlinks (`jsons.ref`)





Module `jsons.encode`
=====================

Function: `jsons.encode.json_encoder()`
-------------------------------------

**Update Mar2016 - PyPy version 5.x appears to have improved C integration to
the point that the C library callbacks are no longer a significant overhead:
This pure Python JSON encoder is no longer faster than a compound C/Python
solution.**

Fast JSON encoder used in `convert.value2json()` when running in Pypy. Run the
[speedtest](https://github.com/klahnakoski/pyLibrary/blob/dev/tests/speedtest_json.py)
to compare with default implementation and ujson


Module `jsons.stream`
=====================

A module supporting the implementation of queries over very large JSON
strings. The overall objective is to make a large JSON document appear like
a hierarchical database, where arrays of any depth, can be queried like
tables.

### Limitations

This is not a generic streaming JSON parser. This module has two main
restrictions:

1. **Objects are not streamed** - All objects will reside in memory. Large
   objects, with a multitude of properties, may cause problems. Property
   names should be known at query time. If you must serialize large objects;
   instead of `{<name>: <value>}` format, try a list of name/value pairs
   instead: `[{"name": <name>, "value": <value>}]` This format is easier to
   query, and gentler on the various document stores that you may put this
   data into.
2. **Array values must be the last object property** - If you query into a
   nested array, all sibling properties found after that array must be ignored
   (must not be in the `expected_vars`). If not, then those arrays will not
   benefit from streaming, and will reside in memory.


Function `jsons.stream.parse()`
-------------------------------

Will return an iterator over all objects found in the JSON stream.

**Parameters:**

* **json** - a parameter-less function, when called returns some number of
  bytes from the JSON stream. It can also be a string.
* **path** - a list of strings specifying the nested JSON paths. Use
  `"."` if your JSON starts with `[`, and is a list.
* **expected_vars** - a list of strings specifying the full property names
  required (all other properties are ignored)


###Examples

**Simple Iteration**

	json = {"b": "done", "a": [1, 2, 3]}
	parse(json, path="a", required_vars=["a", "b"]}

We will iterate through the array found on property `a`, and return both `a` and `b` variables. It will return the following values:

	{"b": "done", "a": 1}
	{"b": "done", "a": 2}
	{"b": "done", "a": 3}


**Bad - Property follows array**

The same query, but different JSON with `b` following `a`:

	json = {"a": [1, 2, 3], "b": "done"}
	parse(json, path="a", required_vars=["a", "b"]}

Since property `b` follows the array we're iterating over, this will raise an error.

**Good - No need for following properties**

The same JSON, but different query, which does not require `b`:

	json = {"a": [1, 2, 3], "b": "done"}
	parse(json, path="a", required_vars=["a"]}

If we do not require `b`, then streaming will proceed just fine:

	{"a": 1}
	{"a": 2}
	{"a": 3}

**Complex Objects**

This streamer was meant for very long lists of complex objects. Use dot-delimited naming to refer to full name of the property

	json = [{"a": {"b": 1, "c": 2}}, {"a": {"b": 3, "c": 4}}, ...
	parse(json, path=".", required_vars=["a.c"])

The dot (`.`) can be used to refer to the top-most array. Notice the structure is maintained, but only includes the required variables.

	{"a": {"c": 2}}
	{"a": {"c": 4}}
	...

**Nested Arrays**

Nested array iteration is meant to mimic a left-join from parent to child table;
as such, it includes every record in the parent.

	json = [
		{"o": 1: "a": [{"b": 1}: {"b": 2}: {"b": 3}: {"b": 4}]},
		{"o": 2: "a": {"b": 5}},
		{"o": 3}
	]
	parse(json, path=[".", "a"], required_vars=["o", "a.b"])

The `path` parameter can be a list, which is used to indicate which properties
are expected to have an array, and to iterate over them. Please notice if no
array is found, it is treated like a singleton array, and missing arrays still
produce a result.

	{"o": 1, "a": {"b": 1}}
	{"o": 1, "a": {"b": 2}}
	{"o": 1, "a": {"b": 3}}
	{"o": 1, "a": {"b": 4}}
	{"o": 2, "a": {"b": 5}}
	{"o": 3}




Module `jsons.ref`
==================

A JSON-like storage format intended for configuration files.

Motivation
----------

This module has superficial similarity to the [JSON Reference Draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pbryan-zyp-json-ref-03), which seems inspired by the committee-driven XPath specification. Of course, there are a few improvements:

1. This `jsons.ref` module uses the dot (`.`) as a path separator in the URL fragment. For example, an absolute reference looks like `{"$ref": "#message.type.name"}`, and a relative reference looks like `{"$ref": "#..type.name"}`.   This syntax better matches that used by Javascript.
2. The additional properties founf in a `$ref` object are used to override the referenced object. This allows you to reference a default document, and override the particular properties needed. *more below*
3. Furthermore, references can accept URL parameters: JSON is treated like a string template for more sophisticated value replacement. *see below*
4. You can reference files and environment variables in addition to general URLs.

Usage
-----

Load your settings easily:

    settings = jsons.ref.get(url):


Comments
--------

End-of-line Comments are allowed, using either `#` or `//` prefix:

```javascript
    {
        "key1": "value1",  //Comment 1
    }
```

```python
        "key1": "value1",  #Comment 1
```

Multiline comments are also allowed, using either Python's triple-quotes
(`""" ... """`) or Javascript's block quotes `/*...*/`

```javascript
    {
        "key1": /* Comment 1 */ "value1",
    }
```

```python
        "key1": """Comment 1""" "value1",
```


Example References
------------------

The `$ref` property is special. Its value is interpreted as a URL pointing to more JSON

###Absolute Internal Reference

The simplest form of URL is an absolute reference to a node in the same
document:


```python
    {
        "message": "Hello world",
        "repeat": {"$ref": "#message"}
    }
```

The reference must start with `#`, and the object with the `$ref` is replaced
with the value it points to:

```python
    {
        "message": "Hello world",
        "repeat": "Hello world"
    }
```

###Relative Internal References

References that start with dot (`.`) are relative, with each additional dot
referring to successive parents.   In this case the `..` refers to the
ref-object's parent, and expands just like the previous example:

```python
    {
        "message": "Hello world",
        "repeat": {"$ref": "#..message"}
    }
```

###File References

Configuration is often stored on the local file system. You can in-line the
JSON found in a file by using the `file://` scheme:

It is good practice to store sensitive data in a secure place...

```python
    {# LOCATED IN C:\users\kyle\password.json
        "host": "database.example.com",
        "username": "kyle",
        "password": "pass123"
    }
```
...and then refer to it in your configuration file:

```python
    {
        "host": "example.com",
        "port": "8080",
        "$ref": "file:///C:/users/kyle/password.json"
    }
```

which will be expanded at run-time to:

```python
    {
        "host": "example.com",
        "port": "8080",
        "username": "kyle",
        "password": "pass123"
    }
```

Please notice the triple slash (`///`) is referring to an absolute file
reference.

###References To Objects

Ref-objects that point to other objects (dicts) are not replaced completely,
but rather are merged with the target; with the ref-object
properties taking precedence.   This is seen in the example above: The "host"
property is not overwritten by the target's.

###Relative File Reference

Here is the same, using a relative file reference; which is relative to the
file that contains this JSON

```python
    {#LOCATED IN C:\users\kyle\dev-debug.json
        "host": "example.com",
        "port": "8080",
        "$ref": "file://password.json"
    }
```

###Home Directory Reference

You may also use the tilde (`~`) to refer to the current user's home directory.
Here is the same again, but this example can be anywhere in the file system.

```python
    {
        "host": "example.com",
        "port": "8080",
        "$ref": "file://~/password.json"
    }
```

###HTTP Reference

Configuration can be stored remotely, especially in the case of larger
configurations which are too unwieldy to inline:

```python
    {
        "schema":{"$ref": "http://example.com/sources/my_db.json"}
    }
```

###Scheme-Relative Reference

You are also able to leave the scheme off, so that whole constellations of
configuration files can refer to each other no matter if they are on the local
file system, or remote:

```python
    {# LOCATED AT SOMEWHERE AT http://example.com
        "schema":{"$ref": "///sources/my_db.json"}
    }
```

And, of course, relative references are also allowed:

```python
    {# LOCATED AT http://example.com/sources/dev-debug.json
        "schema":{"$ref": "//sources/my_db.json"}
    }
```

###Fragment Reference

Some remote configuration files are quite large...

```python
    {# LOCATED IN C:\users\kyle\password.json
        "database":{
            "username": "kyle",
            "password": "pass123"
        },
        "email":{
            "username": "ekyle",
            "password": "pass123"
        }
    }
```

... and you only need one fragment. For this use the hash (`#`) followed by
the dot-delimited path into the document:

```python
    {
        "host": "mail.example.com",
        "username": "ekyle"
        "password": {"$ref": "//~/password.json#email.password"}
    }
```

###Environment Variables Reference

json.ref uses the unconventional `env` scheme for accessing environment variables:

```python
    {
        "host": "mail.example.com",
        "username": "ekyle"
        "password": {"$ref": "env://MAIL_PASSWORD"}
    }
```

##Parameterized References

JSON documents are allowed named parameters, which are surrounded by moustaches `{{.}}`.

```javascript
	{//above_example.json
	 	{{var_name}}: "value"
	}
```

Parameter replacement is performed on the unicode text before being interpreted by the JSON parser. It is your responsibility to ensure the parameter replacement will result in valid JSON.

You pass the parameters by including them as URL parameters:

	{"$ref": "//~/above_example.json?var_name=%22hello%22"}

Which will expand to

```javascript
	{
	 	"hello": "value"
	}
```

The pipe (`|`) symbol can be used to perform some common conversions


```javascript
	{
	 	{{var_name|quote}}: "value"
	}
```

The `quote` transformation will deal with quoting, so ...

	{"$ref": "//~/above_example.json?var_name=hello"}

... expands to the same:

```javascript
	{
	 	"hello": "value"
	}
```

Please see [`expand_template`](../README.md#function-expand_template) for more on the parameter replacement, and transformations available


Module `typed_encoder`
=====================


One reason NoSQL documents stores are wonderful is the fact their schema can automatically expand to accept new properties.   Unfortunately, this flexibility is not limitless: A string assigned to property prevents an object being assigned to the same, or visa-versa.

This module translates JSON documents into "typed" form; which allows document containers to store both objects and primitives in the same property value. This allows storage of values with no containing object!

###How it works

Typed JSON uses `$value` and `$object` properties to markup the original JSON:

* All JSON objects are annotated with `"$object":"."`, which makes querying object existence (especially the empty object) easier.
* All primitive values are replaced with an object with a single `$value` property: So `"value"` gets mapped to `{"$value": "value"}`.

Of course, the typed JSON has a different form than the original, and queries into the documents store must take this into account. Fortunately, the use of typed JSON is intended to be hidden behind a query abstraction layer.


Function `typed_encode()`
------------------------

Accepts a `dict`, `list`, or primitive value, and generates the typed JSON that can be inserted into a document store.


Function `json2typed()`
-----------------------

Converts an existing JSON unicode string and returns the typed JSON unicode string for the same.
